# wordle-solver
This repository contains code solutions to automatically solve the famous 5-letter word guessing game called WORDLE. This repository and code contained within were developed for the purpose of a coding interview for Votee HK 

# Problem Scenario 
Votee will conduct the coding test in a recorded live session. The task is to connect to an API that plays a Wordle-like puzzle. You can find the API documentation here: [Wordle API Documentation](https://wordle.votee.dev:8000/redoc).


Your task is to write a program that automatically guesses random words. You may use any frameworks, IDEs, chatbots, LLMs, or other resources to write your program and showcase your skills. However, if you reference other open-source projects or tutorials, please give proper credit. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and may affect your evaluation.
